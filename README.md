## ParkingControl

Parking Control Project
The Parking Control project is a Java-based parking management system. This system allows for the registration of vehicle 
entry and exit across different parking yards, calculating duration and fees based on parked hours. It utilizes classes such as Customer, Vehicle, Yard, Parking, and Space to model, customer data, vehicles, yards, and parking spaces.

## Key Features:
Registration of vehicle entry and exit.
Automatic calculation of parking duration and fees.
Utilization of lists and parking spaces associated with different yards (mainYard and secondYard).
Utility classes like DataFactory for initial data creation.

This project was developed as part of learning object-oriented programming and demonstrates the use of concepts such as classes, inheritance, encapsulation, interfaces, and data structures in Java.
